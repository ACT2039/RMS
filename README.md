# Restaurant Management System (RMS)

A robust, terminal-based management application built with **C++** utilizing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to streamline restaurant operations.

## Features
- **Menu Management:** Add, update, and remove menu items dynamically.
- **Order Processing:** Generate bills and calculate totals with tax.
- **Role-Based Access:** Separate interfaces for Admin and Staff using **Inheritance**.
- **Data Persistence:** (Optional: mention if you used file handling) Saves records for future reference.

## Technical Concepts Applied
- **Encapsulation:** Used private data members and public getters/setters to ensure secure data handling of billing information.
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Created a base `User` class with derived `Admin` and `Staff` classes to handle specific functionalities.
- **Abstraction:** Simplified complex billing logic through header files and modular functions.
